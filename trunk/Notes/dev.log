I've decided to keep a small development log about the Bounce's
development progress. Today I've implemented dynamic soft
shadow casting to Bounce. It seems like a good idea to set static
bodies to be able to cast shadows, while dynamic bodies that are
moveable can't. The dynamic shadows also gave me an idea for a
fresh new gameplay, where the player is trying to stay in the
shadows created by a moving light source. The player's goal is to
reach the destination only by walking on shadows. While
initially this seemed like a fresh new idea, a closer inspection
revealed that this follows a similar concept as many stealth
assassination games and many top-down view scrolling games also
have this sort of gameplay as well. (An example is the LOST 
game on the iPod Video I used to have.)

P.S: I've also found an interesting piece of music that could work
for Bounce's backgroud music, "Time" by "The American Dollar".

P.S 2: Death zone, where the player loses the game upon collision
also sounds like a good idea.

Came up with an abstract concept story for Bounce. I find the game
as a reflection of myself in the game. The story goes as this.

The moon represents ordinary people like me. The star represents
the ideal person who we want to be. The star can shine, as it has
everything we ever dream of. The moon cannot shine, as it's the
reality that we are stuck with. All we can do is just reflect the
light that the star shines. As we desperatly want to become that
ideal person the moon dreams of, it continuously chases the moon.

I'm still not really sure whether I should make the game a happy
ending with the moon finally being able to shine or a sad ending
with it realizing that it will never shine. For some reason I feel
that making it the sad ending would be more satisfactory to me.

P.S: I didn't realize this while I was writing the concept story, 
but it seems that the story follows a similar concept with the web
comic "Star Chaser".

I've been busy with school. Working on Bounce seems to take away
my usual study time. I worked on to get the code to compile
after the massive renaming scheme, now singleton instances return
pointers instead of references. This was done for the code comple
tion support in Code::Blocks. Also, when passing output values as
parameters, it should take pointers instead of references. (This
I've decided after reading the Google C++ style guide.)

After seeing Hydro(a simple game made with IndieLib)'s source code,
I've reached a conclusion that my current code base is not extendible.
Therefore I recoded everything, it took about two days.

Rewrote EventHandler, nothing much has been done.
Today I've sent an email to Doc about my projects getting academically
recognized. I've been thinking of it being recognized as independent
study topics.
